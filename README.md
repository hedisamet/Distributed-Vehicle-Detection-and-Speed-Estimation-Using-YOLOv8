# Distributed Vehicle Detection and Speed Estimation Using YOLOv8

This project implements a distributed system for detecting vehicles in a video and estimating their speed using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system leverages a socket-based communication architecture to distribute the computational load across multiple machines, significantly reducing the processing time.
